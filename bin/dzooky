=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $ cd Some-Dist-Dir
  $ dzooky

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dzooky is L<Dist::Zilla>'s nephew. He has the ability to summon his uncle.

dzooky will try its best to convert a distribution to use L<Dist::Zilla>. It
supports L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, L<Module::Install> and L<Module::Build> based
distributions, with certain limitations.

Simply execute C<dzooky> in the directory containing the distribution you wish
to convert to L<Dist::Zilla>. C<dzooky> will determine the type of distribution
it is and execute the C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL> and gather meta information
to generate a C<dist.ini> file for you.

It will C<die> on any error conditions it encounters.

=head1 CAVEAT PROGRAMMER

This should be considered as experimental for the moment. It does work in the main
but there are some C<gotchas>.

The L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> examination is done by parsing the C<Makefile> that is
produced by executing C<Makefile.PL>. L<Module::Install> will also fall back to
this mechanism if a C<MYMETA.yml> file is not generated.

The L<Module::Build> examination is purely from C<MYMETA.yml>.

This has some limitations.
